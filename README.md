This project is based off of the Neural Network.Network project created by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague). The source code for his project is available at [this github repository](https://github.com/SebLague/Neural-Network-Experiments).

This is intended to be a Java-based implementation of the C# program written by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague).

This is currently a work-in-progress, it is not fully implemented/configured. Use/modify with this knowledge in mind.
